# Machine Learning Algorithms

## Description
This repository contains projects that specifically make use of the following machine learning algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Decision Tree

## Projects Overview

### 1. Linear Regression
Projects that demonstrate the use of Linear Regression for predicting continuous values based on input features.

### 2. Logistic Regression
Projects that use Logistic Regression for binary classification problems.

### 3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Projects that implement KNN for classification and regression tasks based on the closest training examples in the feature space.

### 4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Projects that utilize SVM for classification and regression by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates the data into classes.

### 5. Random Forest
Projects that use Random Forest, an ensemble method for classification and regression that builds multiple decision trees and merges their results.

### 6. Decision Tree
Projects that demonstrate the use of Decision Trees for making decisions by splitting data into subsets based on the most significant feature.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory you are interested in:
    ```bash
    cd project-directory
    ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook project_notebook.ipynb
    ```
3. Execute the notebook cells to run the project.
